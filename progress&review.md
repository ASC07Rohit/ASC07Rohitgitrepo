# Week 1 README

## Learning

### HTML
- **Tags**: HTML uses various tags to structure content. Each tag serves a specific purpose, such as `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, and `<a>` for links. Tags can have attributes to provide additional information.
- **Semantic Tags**: Semantic HTML tags convey meaning about the content within them, improving accessibility and SEO. Examples include `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`.

### CSS
- **Internal, External, and Inline CSS**:
  - **Internal CSS**: Defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document, affecting only that document.
  - **External CSS**: Stored in a separate `.css` file and linked to HTML files via the `<link>` tag, allowing styles to be reused across multiple pages.
  - **Inline CSS**: Applied directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute, affecting only that specific element.
- **CSS Properties**: Key properties include `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `display`. Each property modifies the appearance and layout of elements.

### Bootstrap
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap provides a grid system that makes it easy to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Predefined Components**: It includes ready-to-use components like buttons, modals, and navbars, speeding up the development process.
- **Customization**: Bootstrap can be customized using variables and SASS, allowing developers to create unique designs while leveraging its functionality.

### JavaScript
- **Arrays**: A data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. Methods like `push()`, `pop()`, and `slice()` are commonly used to manipulate arrays.
- **Data Types**: JavaScript has several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays, which determine the kind of data being handled.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a webpage. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to change content, structure, and styles dynamically.
- **Array Methods**: Useful methods include `filter()` for creating a new array with filtered elements, `map()` for transforming elements, and `forEach()` for iterating over elements.

## Challenges
- **Understanding DOM Structure**: Grasping how the DOM represents HTML elements and how to manipulate them was initially challenging.
- **Map Function**: The concept of higher-order functions like `map()` took some time to understand, particularly in how it transforms arrays.
- **ES6 Features**: Adapting to ES6 syntax, such as arrow functions and template literals, required additional practice to feel comfortable using them.

## Support Required
- Guidance on best practices for organizing CSS in larger projects.
- Clarification on when to use specific JavaScript array methods effectively.
